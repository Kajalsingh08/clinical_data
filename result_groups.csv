Cognitive Processing Therapy, cognitive version only (CPT-C): Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a 12-session manualized therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder. The theory behind CPT conceptualizes PTSD as a disorder of ""non-recovery"" in which erroneous beliefs about the causes and consequences of traumatic events produce strong negative emotions and prevent accurate processing of the trauma memory and natural emotions emanating from the event. A significant contributor to the interruption of natural recovery process is the ongoing use of avoidance as a coping strategy.

The theory behind CPT conceptualizes PTSD as a disorder of ""non-recovery"" in which erroneous beliefs about the causes and consequences of traumatic events produce strong negative emotions and prevent accurate processing of the trauma memory and natural emotions emanating from the event. A significant contributor to the interruption of natural recovery process is the ongoing use of avoidance as a coping strategy.

Cognitive Processing Therapy, cognitive version only (CPT-C): Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a 12-session manualized therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder. The theory behind CPT conceptualizes PTSD as a disorder of ""non-recovery"" in which erroneous beliefs about the causes and consequences of traumatic events produce strong negative emotions and prevent accurate processing of the trauma memory and natural emotions emanating from the event. A significant contributor to the interruption of natural recovery process is the ongoing use of avoidance as a coping strategy. CPT incorporates trauma-specific cognitive techniques to help individuals with PTSD more accurately appraise these ""stuck points"" and progress toward recovery.",

Adaptive Disclosure (AD): Adaptive Disclosure (AD) is an eight-session fully manualized and piloted intervention designed specifically for Marines with PTSD stemming from a variety of traumatic deployment experiences. The approach combines imaginal exposure to activate trauma-related emotions and beliefs and cognitive and experiential techniques to modify maladaptive interpretations of the implication of various combat and operational experiences that contribute to symptoms and dysfunction.",

Lumbar Sympathetic Block: A lumbar sympathetic block is an injection in the middle of the lower back, toward the left or right side. The ""lumbar sympathetic nerves"" are a small bundle of nerves that carries ""sympathetic"" nerve signals from the lower extremities. In some instances, certain injuries to the lower extremities can cause a burning, unusual pain called complex regional pain syndrome or reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Injecting a small amount of local anesthetic on the lumbar sympathetic nerves can identify whether or not this pain is carried by the sympathetic nervous system.

Lumbar Sympathetic Block: A lumbar sympathetic block is an injection in the middle of the lower back, toward the left or right side.

In some instances, certain injuries to the lower extremities can cause a burning, unusual pain called complex regional pain syndrome or reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Injecting a small amount of local anesthetic on the lumbar sympathetic nerves can identify whether or not this pain is carried by the sympathetic nervous system.

Virtual reality exposure therapy: Virtual reality exposure (VRE) therapy is a form of exposure therapy in which participants are helped to confront their traumatic memories in a therapeutic manner. They describe the events out loud and their therapist attempts to match what they are describing in the virtual reality. This is done repeatedly, allowing distress associated with these memories to decrease. Material that emerges during the VRE exposure is processed, or discussed, after the exposure, allowing participants to think about themselves and the event differently.

Injecting a small amount of local anesthetic on the lumbar sympathetic nerves can identify whether or not this pain is carried by the sympathetic nervous system.

Injecting a small amount of local anesthetic on the lumbar sympathetic nerves can identify whether or not this pain is carried by the sympathetic nervous system.

Lumbar Sympathetic Block: A lumbar sympathetic block is an injection in the middle of the lower back, toward the left or right side. The ""lumbar sympathetic nerves"" are a small bundle of nerves that carries ""sympathetic"" nerve signals from the lower extremities. In some instances, certain injuries to the lower extremities can cause a burning, unusual pain called complex regional pain syndrome or reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Injecting a small amount of local anesthetic on the lumbar sympathetic nerves can identify whether or not this pain is carried by the sympathetic nervous system.

Skin conductance algesimeter: The real-time changes in skin conductance indices can be monitored at the skin level, by use of non-invasive electrodes attached to the skin (similar to EKG electrodes) connected to the skin conductance algesimete",

Shockwave Lithoplasty® Peripheral Lithoplasty System: The Shockwave Lithoplasty® System is a proprietary lithotripsy-enhanced balloon catheter that is designed to be delivered through the peripheral arterial system of the lower extremities to the site of calcified stenosis. Activating the lithotripsy within the device will generate pulsatile mechanical energy within the target treatment site, disrupt calcium within the lesion and allow subsequent dilation of a peripheral artery stenosis using low balloon pressure. The system consists of a balloon catheter with multiple integrated lithotripsy electrodes, and a generator.

Medtronic IN.PACT (DCB): The IN.PACT Admiral DCB is an over-the-wire (OTW) balloon catheter with a drug-coated balloon at the distal tip. The drug component, referred to as the FreePac™ drug coating, consists of the drug paclitaxel and the excipient urea. The device component physically dilates the vessel lumen by PTA, and the drug is intended to reduce the proliferative response that is associated with restenosis.",103409442.0

Academic Detailing: Academic detailing is an individual and facility-level intervention consistently shown to improve provider behavior. This strategy addresses the intervention functions of persuasion, coercion, modeling, and education which are effective methods for affecting behaviors driven by beliefs about capabilities, knowledge, social influences, beliefs about consequences, and environmental context and resources.

For the next four weeks while he/she is still enrolled in the study, he/she will have his/her options for food choices which are not controlled for the study.

""Jump-Start"" meal plan: The ""Jump-Start"" plan will provide Atkins frozen meals at breakfast, lunch and dinner and these meals will be supplemented with fresh salads and vegetables. There will be no difference in terms of calories or nutrient composition between ""Grab-and-Go"" meal plan versus ""Jump-Start"" meal plan. The amount of weight loss caused by these two meal plans is not expected to differ.",
